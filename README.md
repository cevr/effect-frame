# Effect Frame

An Effect-native full-stack framework in design and implementation.

The [first-release map](https://github.com/cevr/effect-frame/issues/1) is the source of truth for scope and decisions. GitHub child issues hold the open questions.

## First release

- One explicit actor interface for simple state and state machines.
- Local and remote actor hosts.
- Declarative JSX for browser and OpenTUI clients.
- Server rendering and hydration.
- Real celld persistence for state, accepted commands, command results, and resumable machine work.
- Alchemy as the infrastructure interface.

These are release requirements. They are not implemented features.

## Current state

The workspace contains the project tools and their compatibility probes. It does not yet contain a framework runtime. The actor API, renderer adapter, and recovery model remain open decisions on the map.

The private `tooling/checks` workspace checks Effect v4 schema codecs, scope cleanup, and browser bundling. It is not a framework package.

## Commands

```sh
bun install
bun run gate
```

The gate runs strict lint, format checks, patched TypeScript checks, a browser build, and tests. Effect runtime versions are pinned in the root catalog. Type checks use the patched `tsc` binary.

No cloud deployment or npm publication is configured.

## Planning

Read [the GitHub tracker guide](docs/wayfinder/github.md) before changing the map. Read source findings in `docs/research/` when they are available.
