`View.bind`, `View.event`, `View.submit` and `View.select` are module functions, and `View.Context` and `Capabilities` are gone. `bind` was already data, and a prepared event is now data too: the runtime forks the handler into the scope of the branch or row that owns the element, when the host fires. A plain function that returns a `Node` needs nothing from the view that calls it; a setup that reads no service needs no generator. Migration: delete `const view = yield* View.Context` and replace `view.bind` with `View.bind` (and so on), and drop `View.Context` from any `R` you named.
