Contracts and hosts say less. `query()` defaults `version` to 1, `depends` to none and `policy` to `"public"`, and every host resolves `"public"` without a `QueryPolicies` layer (a table entry of that name still replaces it). `ActorHost.layer` no longer requires `store`: omitted, each actor gets an in-memory mailbox, which is what a query-only host or a test wants.
