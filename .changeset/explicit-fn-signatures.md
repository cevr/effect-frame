"effect-frame": patch
---

Give `ready`, `readyWithStale`, `orErrored`, `fakeQuery` and `Router.mount` explicit signatures. tsgo emitted their `Effect.fn` generics as unbound type parameters with `unknown` error and requirement types, which made every consumer of the published declarations infer `unknown` and fail to type check.
