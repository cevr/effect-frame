`Show` narrows. `when` takes any source with an `is` test (a type predicate narrows), the children may be a function of a source of the tested value that exists only while the branch is shown, and `fallback` draws otherwise. `Query` is the one control for a query's three states: `loading`, `failed(error)` and `ready(value, stale)`, each a source, with no placeholder value to name. `Await` is `Query` as a view and drops `before`. `QueryState` gains `isLoading`, `isReady`, `isFailed` and `match` (also under the `QueryState` name in both entries), and `QueryFailure` is a Schema with an `isQueryFailure` guard, so an `Errored` fallback narrows its `unknown` in one call.
