`View.list({ each, keyBy, setup })` is a keyed list whose rows run a setup Effect in a scope of their own: a row may make cells, follow queries and add finalizers, and the scope closes when the row leaves. A setup that completes at once builds before the mount returns; one that suspends lands in its place when it completes, and the mount closing interrupts it. `list` is an Effect, not a JSX element, because it captures the context it is yielded in and the enclosing view's `R` names what the rows need. `<For>` is unchanged and is the plain case of the same node.
